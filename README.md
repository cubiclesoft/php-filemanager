Getting Started
---------------

Download or clone the latest software release.  Transfer the files to a web server directory of your choosing.

Visit 'install.php' with a web browser to start the installer.  The installer provides a guided interface for setting up the application.  While File Manager does come with a basic login system, it is recommended that you use your own existing login system by creating an appropriate 'index_hook.php' file to control user access to the tool.  After installation completes, don't forget to secure the main directory on the server.

That's it!  You now have a fast, lightweight PHP and Javascript-based file manager and code editor.
